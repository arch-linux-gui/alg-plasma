### Arch Linux GUI

This is the official ISO building repository for Arch Linux GUI

unix-name: arch-linux-gui


The purpose of ALG is to act as a repository testbed for & between two other distributions and to act as a Vanilla Arch distribution.

Building will yield a STOCK KDE Plasma desktop environment with Calamares installer. This ISO then can be install on a physical hard drive, either as a single Arch Linux Installation (with few additional software), or dual boot with another operating system. The installtion is offline, and you only need internet to download additional packages if you want to or see the Arch LOGO. ISO yielded is around 1.3GB at this point.

You can skip the hassle of building by directly downloading from ALG's <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/arch-linux-gui/">official page</a>.
